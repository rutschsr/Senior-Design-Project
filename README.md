# Abstract
The original goal of this project was to create a power measurement system that could log the power consumption of various perophirals plugged into a power strip.  This would give an idea of how much power each piece of equipment was using at any given time.  

Before work on the project began, we changed the overall scope of the project to determine the power consumption on a Raspberry Pi for various Python and Objective-C scripts.  These scripts will call several different functions including sending email messages, writing to files, accessing webpages, and performing basic arithmetic operations.
